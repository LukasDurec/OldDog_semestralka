        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

           <p>Your tattoo cost is an investment in permanent body art that you'll wear every day.
               The last thing you want is a super-cheap tattoo that you might have to pay double the cost of to remove it if you don't like it later.
               That's why the best tattoo artists work thoughtfully to create designs with long-lasting appeal.
               This guide will provide general tattoo price ranges only.</p>

            Getting one short word tattoo that covers 2 to 4 square inches runs from $50 to $200, depending on the size of the letters and usually takes an hour of work or less.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most artists don't charge on a per letter basis. When you're talking to your tattoo artist,
            ask for their hourly rates and how long it would take to do a lettering tattoo in the size you want on which specific part of your body.
        </p>
        <p>
            A small tattoo costs $50 to $250 on average for designs that cover 3 square inches of skin or less. Regardless of the size, you have
            to pay the shop minimum fee of around $50 or more,
            and then they usually charge an hourly rate as well after the first hour. Also, you may pay extra for them to work on a custom design for you.
